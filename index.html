        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <h4>ST. XAVIER’S COLLEGE, Kathmandu, is an educational institution of higher learning established and managed by the Nepal Jesuit Society.
            Jesuits began their educational work in Nepal in 1951 with the opening of St. Xavier’s School, Godavari, followed by St. Xavier’s School, Jawalakhel,
            St. Xavier’s School, Deonia, Moran Memorial School, Maheshpur, and St. Xavier’s School, Sadakbari. The Jesuits have served people of all faiths, all
            over the world, as educators, scientists, explorers and social reformers since 1540. The centuries-old tradition of service to others is the cornerstone of Jesuit
            education. Every institute and organization established by the Jesuits in Nepal, prepares each student to Live for God and Lead for Nepal. The education
            programme is designed to foster criticalthinking, positive action and service to others. It challenges students to look beyond career, and have a wider vision
            of being channels of betterment. It encourages every student to be a job creator rather than a job seeker, and to play the role of being a creative designer of the
            future.
